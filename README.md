# Automatic Orchestra

## Library for Arduino

This library contains the source code for the sound installation *Automatic Orchestra* which was first presented at the [Resonate](http://resonate.io/)festival in 2015. Originally conceived as a collaboration between the [University of the Arts Bremen](http://www.hfk-bremen.de/en) and the [Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID)](http://ciid.dk/) the project continued to be exhibited and extended in a series of workshops.

This library contains the source code of the framework and the original compositions presented at Resonate. In addition the results of the ongoing development will also be added to this repository.
